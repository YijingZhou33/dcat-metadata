The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, seeAccuracy of the Data).

The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.",English,"Oakland County, Michigan","Oakland County, Michigan",Geospatial data,,landuse|planning|parcels,2021-02-17T20:09:22.000Z,,,,"Clawson, Michigan|Royal Oak, Michigan|Madison Heights, Michigan|Washtenaw County, Michigan|Lake Angelus, Michigan|Wayne County, Michigan|Livingston County, Michigan|Walled Lake, Michigan|Birmingham, Michigan|Oak Park, Michigan|Huntington Woods, Michigan|Rochester Hills, Michigan|Sylvan Lake, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Macomb County, Michigan|Auburn Hills, Michigan|Novi, Michigan|Wixom, Michigan|Farmington, Michigan|Southfield, Michigan|Oakland County, Michigan|Village Of Clarkston, Michigan|Farmington Hills, Michigan|Berkley, Michigan|Pleasant Ridge, Michigan|Pontiac, Michigan|Hazel Park, Michigan|Rochester, Michigan|South Lyon, Michigan|Lathrup Village, Michigan|Keego Harbor, Michigan|Troy, Michigan|Ferndale, Michigan|Orchard Lake Village, Michigan|Michigan","-83.6943,42.4261,-83.0743,42.8936",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c60463c62ffa4600bdd3ffe70ee6198f_4,https://accessoakland.oakgov.com/datasets/c60463c62ffa4600bdd3ffe70ee6198f_4.zip,https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseOpenPlanningMapService/MapServer/4,,,c60463c62ffa4600bdd3ffe70ee6198f_4,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/c60463c62ffa4600bdd3ffe70ee6198f_4,Michigan State University,06b-26125,06b-26125,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False,320.5827 MB

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water.

,Maryland LiDAR Wicomico County - DEM Feet,"Aerial Cartographics of America, Inc. collected LiDAR for over 681 square miles in Accomack, Dorchester, Somerset, Sussex, Wicomico, and Worchester Counties in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia. The nominal pulse spacing for this project was no greater than 0.7 meters. This project was collected with a Riegl LMS-Q680i Full Waveform LiDAR Sensor which collects an intensity value, GPS Week Time, Flightline and echo number attributes for each discrete pulse. Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS into an initial ground surface.

,Maryland LiDAR Washington County - Slope,"Dewberry collected LiDAR for ~3,942 square miles in various Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland Counties. The acquisition was performed by Geodigital. This metadata covers the LiDAR produced for the Washington County project area. The nominal pulse spacing for this project is 1.6 ft (0.5 meters). This project was collected with a sensor which collects intensity values for each discrete pulse extracted from the waveform. GPS Week Time, Intensity, Flightline and echo number attributes were provided for each LiDAR point. Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS according to contract specifications: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, 10-Ignored Ground due to breakline proximity, and 11-Withheld. Dewberry produced 3D breaklines and combined these with the final LiDAR data to produce seamless hydro flattened DEMs for the 638 tiles (1500 m x 1500 m) that cover this deliverable.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

,Maryland LiDAR Montgomery County - Hillshade,"Montgomery and Prince George's counties project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (HARN), State Plane, Feet and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), Feet. Lidar data was delivered as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to 1,413 individual 4000 ft x 6000 ft tiles, as tiled Intensity Rasters, and as tiled bare-earth DEM; all tiled to the same 4000 ft x 6000 ft schema. Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in early to mid 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. Sensor errors in mulitple locations were identified in processing, additonal acquisition on 7/20/2018 was completed to remedy the errors. 2016 lidar data was used with approval in a single area of restricted airspace. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Sanborn Map Company, Inc. established a total of 23 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 79 independent accuracy check points in Open Terrain and Urban landcovers were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data.

Lidar data was delivered as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to 1,413 individual 4000 ft x 6000 ft tiles, as tiled Intensity Rasters, and as tiled bare-earth DEM; all tiled to the same 4000 ft x 6000 ft schema. Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in early to mid 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. Sensor errors in mulitple locations were identified in processing, additonal acquisition on 7/20/2018 was completed to remedy the errors. 2016 lidar data was used with approval in a single area of restricted airspace. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Sanborn Map Company, Inc. established a total of 23 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 79 independent accuracy check points in Open Terrain and Urban landcovers were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data.

Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LiDAR Specification, Version 1. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of UTM Zone 18 North, NAD83, meters and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), meters. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.2 Files formatted to 2283 individual 1500m x 1500m tiles, and corresponding Intensity Images and Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 1500m x 1500m schema, and Breaklines in ESRI Shapefile format. The data was then converted to a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 Maryland State Plane Coordinate System, Feet. LiDAR was delivered in Classified LAS 1.2 Files formatted to 1927 individual 4000' x 6000' tiles, and corresponding Intensity Images and Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 4000' x 6000' schema, and Breaklines in ESRI Shapefile format.

,Maryland LiDAR Frederick County - Hillshade,"Dewberry collected LiDAR for ~3,942 square miles in various Virginia, WestVirginia, and Maryland Counties. The acquisition was performed by Geodigital. This metadata covers the LiDAR produced for the Fairfax, Fauquier, Frederick, and Jefferson County project area. The nominal pulse spacing for this project is 1.6 ft (0.5 meters). This project was collected with a sensor which collects intensity values for each discrete pulse extracted from the waveform. GPS Week Time, Intensity, Flightline and echo number attributes were provided for each LiDAR point. Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS according to contract specifications: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, 10-Ignored Ground due to breakline proximity, and 11-Withheld. Dewberry produced 3D breaklines and combined these with the final LiDAR data to produce seamless hydro flattened DEMs for the 2150 tiles (1500 m x 1500 m) that cover this deliverable.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

This metadata covers the LiDAR produced for the Fairfax, Fauquier, Frederick, and Jefferson County project area. The nominal pulse spacing for this project is 1.6 ft (0.5 meters). This project was collected with a sensor which collects intensity values for each discrete pulse extracted from the waveform. GPS Week Time, Intensity, Flightline and echo number attributes were provided for each LiDAR point. Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS according to contract specifications: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, 10-Ignored Ground due to breakline proximity, and 11-Withheld. Dewberry produced 3D breaklines and combined these with the final LiDAR data to produce seamless hydro flattened DEMs for the 2150 tiles (1500 m x 1500 m) that cover this deliverable.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LiDAR Specification, Version 1. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of UTM Zone 17, NAD83 (2011), meters and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), meters. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 6 individual 1829 meter X 1219 meter tiles for the pilot (948 individual 1829 meter X 1219 meter tiles for the entire project area), and corresponding Intensity Images and Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 1829 meter X 1219 meter tile schema, and Breaklines in Esri geodatabase format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in spring of 2015, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

This project was collected with a Riegl LMS-Q680i Full Waveform LiDAR Sensor which collects an intensity value, GPS Week Time, Flightline and echo number attributes for each discrete pulse . Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS into an initial ground surface. Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS and then performed manual classifications according to project specifications: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, and 10-Ignored Ground due to breakline proximity. Dewberry produced 3D breaklines and combined these with the final LiDAR data to produce seamless DTMs, DSMs and hydro flattened DEMs, for 833 tiles (1500 meters x 1500 meters) that cover the project area.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

,Maryland Incentive Zones - Opportunity Zones,"The Opportunity Zone program is a nationwide initiative administered by the U.S. Treasury created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The program provides federal tax incentives for investment in distressed communities over the next 10 years. Areas designated as Opportunity Zones will be able to reap the benefits of capital gains to help redevelop undeserved communities. The state was entitled to nominate 149 low-income census tracts to be Opportunity Zones.

Locations of moving violations are identified from a database provided by theDistrictDepartment of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data is summarized by ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation.The summary form was created as a series of aggregated street segment data, in order to view spatial patterns on a weekly basis. This is a temporal crosstab of violation types (defined below) by week and time of day (ranges defined below).Users are able to query by week to get a DC-wide yearly and weekly perspective on over 40 different combinations of violations. Create interesting street segment heat maps which can get quite specific to identify patterns and answer questions.
